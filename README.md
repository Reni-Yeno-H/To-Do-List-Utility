# To-Do-List-Utility :clipboard:
This is a CISC 3650 website project of Spring 2022.<br />
CISC 3650 project of creating a To-Do-webpage from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.

`Objective:` <br />
The goal of this project is to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a working to do list. <br />
Note that a to do list is an HTML unordered list (< ul >) with CSS formatting and JavaScript functionality. <br /> 
The goal is to create a well-designed user interface using client-side programming without the need to store any information on a server or in a database. <br />
In addition to learning and practice Web development skills, the emphasis of this project is on designing the interface in an intuitive and clear way that maximizes the user experience. <br />

Affordance:
- [x] Allow user to create tasklist or subtask list with color priority and set due date functionality.

Constraint:
- [x] Created subtask lists appears under the first super task list meaning users can't create subtasks under a specific super task besides the first one.

Part A: Core Tasks
- [x] 1.) Create a website using HTML and Bootstrap (use the starter template and include the
responsive meta-tag to make your site responsive on mobile devices). (2 pts)
- [x] 2.) Add a list of tasks and use CSS to format the list so that it is a well-designed to do list. Be
thoughtful and intentional about your design. (2 pts)
- [x] 3.) Allow the user to add items to the to do list. (This will require additional HTML elements
as well as JavaScript.) (2 pts)
- [x] 4.) Allow the user to check items off their list after the tasks have been completed. (2 pts)
- [x] 5.) Allow the user to delete tasks from the list. (Note that this is not the same as completing
tasks; the user may decide that it was an error to have included the tasks in the first
place.) (2 pts)

Part B: Make it Better
- [x] 6.) Allow users to associate a due date with a task and display the due dates next to the
tasks. (Use <input type="date"> for the date input.) (2 pts)
- [x] 7.) Allow users to uncheck items that were accidentally checked. (1 pts)

Part C: Even Better
- [x] 8.) Allow users to color code tasks to indicate priority or type of task. (2 pts)
- [x] 9.) Give some sort of feedback when users complete a task â€“ visual or sound or both. (See
Google Tasks for an example.) Again, be thoughtful and deliberate about your design. (1
pt)

Part D: Cherry on Top
- [x] 10.) Allow users to define subtasks. Subtasks should be able to be checked off/deleted
individually OR checked off /deleted together with the super-task. (1 pt)

## List of unintentional minor bug(s):<br />
1.) Advanced Notepad does not have cross out function.<br />
2.) Due Date calculation only works for the first item and will stay the same unchanged.<br />
3.) Subtask only works correctly for the first item (as in any subtasks input gets added to the first super task)<br />
4.) Subtask button doesn't appear in the advanced notepad after creating task.<br />
5.) Github pages either doesn't allow notepad to be draggable or the response time for it work are long and random.<br />
